.TH NETSHARK_OPEN_DEAD 3NETSHARK "3 January 2014"
.SH NAME
netshark_open_dead, netshark_open_dead_with_tstamp_precision \- open a fake
netshark_t for compiling filters or opening a capture for output
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR netshark_open_dead ()
and
.BR netshark_open_dead_with_tstamp_precision ()
are used for creating a
.B netshark_t
structure to use when calling the other functions in libnetshark.  It is
typically used when just using libnetshark for compiling BPF code; it can
also be used if using
.BR netshark_dump_open (3NETSHARK),
.BR netshark_dump (3NETSHARK),
and
.BR netshark_dump_close (3NETSHARK)
to write a savefile if there is no
.B netshark_t
that supplies the packets to be written.
.PP
.I linktype
specifies the link-layer type for the
.BR netshark_t .
.PP
.I snaplen
specifies the snapshot length for the
.BR netshark_t .
.PP
When
.BR netshark_open_dead_with_tstamp_precision (),
is used to create a
.B netshark_t
for use with
.BR netshark_dump_open (),
.I precision
specifies the time stamp precision for packets;
.B NETSHARK_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO
should be specified if the packets to be written have time stamps in
seconds and microseconds, and
.B NETSHARK_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO
should be specified if the packets to be written have time stamps in
seconds and nanoseconds.  Its value does not affect
.BR netshark_compile (3NETSHARK).
.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
The
.BR netshark_open_dead_with_tstamp_precision ()
function became available in libnetshark release 1.5.1.  In previous
releases, there was no mechanism to open a savefile for writing with
time stamps given in seconds and nanoseconds.
