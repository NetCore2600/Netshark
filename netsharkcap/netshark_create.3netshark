.SH NAME
netshark_create \- create a live capture handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <netshark/netshark.h>
.ft
.LP
.nf

char errbuf[NETSHARK_ERRBUF_SIZE];
.ft

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR netshark_create ()
is used to create a packet capture handle to capture packets on a device
(typically a network interface, see
.BR \%netshark_findalldevs (3NETSHARK)
for a more detailed explanation).
.I source
is a string that specifies the capture device to open, in this function
.B NULL
means the same as the string "any".
.I errbuf
is a buffer large enough to hold at least
.B NETSHARK_ERRBUF_SIZE
chars.
.PP
The returned handle must be activated with
.BR netshark_activate (3NETSHARK)
before packets can be captured
with it; options for the capture, such as promiscuous mode, can be set
on the handle before activating it.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR netshark_create ()
returns a
.B netshark_t *
on success and
.B NULL
on failure.
If
.B NULL
is returned,
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message.
