.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR netshark_open_offline ()
and
.BR netshark_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision ()
are called to open a ``savefile'' for reading.
.PP
.I fname
specifies the name of the file to open. The file can have the netshark file
format as described in
.BR \%netshark-savefile (@MAN_FILE_FORMATS@),
which is the file format used by, among other programs,
.BR tcpdump (1)
and
.BR tcpslice (1),
or can have the netsharkng file format, although not all netsharkng files can
be read.
The name "-" is a synonym for
.BR stdin .
.PP
.BR netshark_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision ()
takes an additional
.I precision
argument specifying the time stamp precision desired;
if
.B NETSHARK_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO
is specified, packet time stamps will be supplied in seconds and
microseconds,
and if
.B NETSHARK_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO
is specified, packet time stamps will be supplied in seconds and
nanoseconds.  If the time stamps in the file do not have the same
precision as the requested precision, they will be scaled up or down as
necessary before being supplied.
.PP
Alternatively, you may call
.BR netshark_fopen_offline ()
or
.BR netshark_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision ()
to read dumped data from an existing open stream
.IR fp ;
this stream will be closed by a subsequent call to
.BR netshark_close (3NETSHARK)
unless it is
.BR stdin .
.BR netshark_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision ()
takes an additional
.I precision
argument as described above.
Note that on Windows, that stream should be opened in binary mode.
.PP
.I errbuf
is a buffer large enough to hold at least
.B NETSHARK_ERRBUF_SIZE
chars.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR netshark_open_offline (),
.BR netshark_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision (),
.BR netshark_fopen_offline (),
and
.BR netshark_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision ()
return a
.B netshark_t *
on success and
.B NULL
on failure.
If
.B NULL
is returned,
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message.
.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
.BR netshark_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision ()
and
.BR netshark_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision ()
became available in libnetshark release 1.5.1.  In previous releases, time
stamps from a savefile are always given in seconds and microseconds.
