.SH NAME
netshark_list_tstamp_types, netshark_free_tstamp_types \- get a list of time
stamp types supported by a capture device, and free that list
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <netshark/netshark.h>

.LP
.ft B
int netshark_list_tstamp_types(netshark_t *p, int **tstamp_typesp);
void netshark_free_tstamp_types(int *tstamp_types);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR netshark_list_tstamp_types ()
is used to get a list of the supported time stamp types of the interface
associated with the netshark descriptor.
.BR netshark_list_tstamp_types ()
allocates an array to hold the list and sets
.I *tstamp_typesp
to point to the array.
See
.BR \%netshark-tstamp (@MAN_MISC_INFO@)
for a list of all the time stamp types.
.PP
The caller is responsible for freeing the array with
.BR netshark_free_tstamp_types (),
which frees the list pointed to by
.IR tstamp_types .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR netshark_list_tstamp_types ()
returns the number of time stamp types in the array on success and
.B NETSHARK_ERROR
on failure.
A return value of one means that the only time stamp type supported is
the one in the list, which is the capture device's default time stamp
type.  A return value of zero means that the only time stamp type
supported is
.BR NETSHARK_TSTAMP_HOST ,
which is the capture device's default time stamp type (only older
versions of libnetshark will return that; newer versions will always return
one or more types).
If
.B NETSHARK_ERROR
is returned,
.BR netshark_geterr (3NETSHARK)
or
.BR netshark_perror (3NETSHARK)
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
.PP
These functions became available in libnetshark release 1.2.1.  In previous
releases, the time stamp type cannot be set; only the default time stamp
type offered by a capture source is available.
