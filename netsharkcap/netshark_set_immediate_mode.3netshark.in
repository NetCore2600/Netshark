.TH NETSHARK_SET_IMMEDIATE_MODE 3NETSHARK "27 January 2024"
.SH NAME
netshark_set_immediate_mode \- set immediate mode for a not-yet-activated capture
handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <netshark/netshark.h>
.LP
.ft B
int netshark_set_immediate_mode(netshark_t *p, int immediate_mode);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR netshark_set_immediate_mode ()
sets whether immediate mode should be set on a capture handle when
the handle is activated.  In immediate mode, packets are always
delivered as soon as they arrive, with no buffering.
If
.I immediate_mode
is non-zero, immediate mode will be set, otherwise it will not be set.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR netshark_set_immediate_mode ()
returns
.B 0
on success or
.B NETSHARK_ERROR_ACTIVATED
if called on a capture handle that has been activated.
.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
.PP
This function became available in libnetshark release 1.5.0.  In previous
releases, if immediate delivery of packets is required:
.IP
on FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, macOS, and Solaris 11,
immediate mode must be turned on with a
.B BIOCIMMEDIATE
.BR ioctl (2),
as documented in
.BR bpf (@MAN_DEVICES@),
on the descriptor returned by
.BR netshark_fileno (3NETSHARK),
after
.BR netshark_activate (3NETSHARK)
is called;
.IP
on Solaris 10 and earlier versions of Solaris, immediate mode must be
turned on by using a read timeout of 0 when opening the device (this
will not provide immediate delivery of packets on other platforms, so
don't assume it's sufficient);
.IP
on Windows, immediate mode must be turned on by calling
.BR netshark_setmintocopy ()
with a size of 0.
.PP
On Linux, with previous releases of libnetshark, capture devices are always
in immediate mode; however, in 1.5.0 and later, they are, by default,
.B not
in immediate mode, so if
.BR netshark_set_immediate_mode ()
is available, it should be used.
.PP
On other platforms, capture devices are always in immediate mode.
