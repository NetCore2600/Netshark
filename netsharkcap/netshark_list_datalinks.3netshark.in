.SH NAME
netshark_list_datalinks, netshark_free_datalinks \- get a list of link-layer header
types supported by a capture device, and free that list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <netshark/netshark.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int netshark_list_datalinks(netshark_t *p, int **dlt_buf);
void netshark_free_datalinks(int *dlt_list);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR netshark_list_datalinks ()
is used to get a list of the supported link-layer header types of the
interface associated with the netshark descriptor.
.BR netshark_list_datalinks ()
allocates an array to hold the list and sets
.IR *dlt_buf
to point to that array.
.LP
The caller is responsible for freeing the array with
.BR netshark_free_datalinks (),
which frees the list of link-layer header types pointed to by
.IR dlt_list .
.LP
It must not be called on a netshark descriptor created by
.BR \%netshark_create (3NETSHARK)
that has not yet been activated by
.BR \%netshark_activate (3NETSHARK).
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR netshark_list_datalinks ()
returns the number of link-layer header types in the array on success,
.B NETSHARK_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED
if called on a capture handle that has been created but not activated,
and
.B NETSHARK_ERROR
on other errors.
If
.B NETSHARK_ERROR
is returned,
.BR netshark_geterr (3NETSHARK)
or
.BR \%netshark_perror (3NETSHARK)
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
