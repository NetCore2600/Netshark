.TH NETSHARK_SET_TSTAMP_TYPE 3NETSHARK "8 September 2019"
.SH NAME
netshark_set_tstamp_type \- set the time stamp type to be used by a
capture device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <netshark/netshark.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int netshark_set_tstamp_type(netshark_t *p, int tstamp_type);
.ft

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR netshark_set_tstamp_type ()
sets the type of time stamp desired for packets captured on the netshark
descriptor to the type specified by
.IR tstamp_type .
It must be called on a netshark descriptor created by
.BR netshark_create (3NETSHARK)
that has not yet been activated by
.BR netshark_activate (3NETSHARK).
.BR netshark_list_tstamp_types (3NETSHARK)
will give a list of the time stamp types supported by a given capture
device.
See
.BR \%netshark-tstamp (@MAN_MISC_INFO@)
for a list of all the time stamp types.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR netshark_set_tstamp_type ()
returns
.B 0
on success if the specified time stamp type is expected to be
supported by the capture device,
.B NETSHARK_WARNING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP
if the specified time stamp type is not supported by the
capture device,
.B NETSHARK_ERROR_ACTIVATED
if called on a capture handle that has been activated, and
.B NETSHARK_ERROR_CANTSET_TSTAMP_TYPE
if the capture device doesn't support setting the time stamp type (only
older versions of libnetshark will return that; newer versions will always
allow the time stamp type to be set to the default type).
.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
.PP
This function became available in libnetshark release 1.2.1.  In previous
releases, the time stamp type cannot be set; only the default time stamp
type offered by a capture source is available.
